First, be aware that this link is very unstable. It *does* work but not 100% of the time due to timing inconsistencies with the two emulators. Your computer's specs play a role in if/how often the connection works.

## Here's what you need

* [VBA-M](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbam/)
* Dolphin 5 (other versions *may* work, dolphin comes out with new versions multiple times a week)
* GBA bios ([responsible for the nintendo logo on startup screen](http://imgur.com/byn7Kfb))
* Obviously a GBA and GC game that can connect
Here are the settings you'll need to change in VBA-M.

### On VBA

Go to GBA options and check "use bios file"

Click configure and select the bios file to be used

## Making the connection

1. When prompted by the gamecube game to turn on your GBA, you need to [import the battery file](http://imgur.com/O9SIcLf)
```
Note: If the connection isn't made immediately, you can try restarting the game or reimporting the battery file. If the connection is made but you get an error, just keep trying.
```

2. After some resetting, [it will work](http://imgur.com/73hIBIT)
